      <description>Managing mentorship with a full-time job, is a very tedious task. You cannot just go with a ‘spray and pray’ approach, every time. Occasionally it needs a personal touch.
Not to mention, helping people to become their best selves is already a complicated thing. And, adding to it, are the following problems, which mentors face:-
 How to show and present your services to your prospective customers Scheduling calls with your mentees and striking a healthy work-life balance Seamlessly getting paid Collecting leads of prospective students  And, this is where we come and save a mentor’s day.</description>
