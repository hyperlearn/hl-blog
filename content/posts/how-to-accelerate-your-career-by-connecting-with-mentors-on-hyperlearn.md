Before you start looking for a mentor, we ask you a simple question - why get a mentor, at all?

Well, Sir Issac Newton once said- “**If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”** 

To put it simply, he is referring to **his mentors, predecessors and the people who inspired and helped him solve his doubt in his notable career.**

So, to get optimal results, you clearly must use the insights of an experienced person, who went through a process to gain valuable results and knowledge.

In our case, it's a mentor!

# Learning from an ideal mentor

When it comes to learning, you might ask- if these mentors are available for free on platforms such as YouTube, why would I get a 1×1 mentor?

See, the thing is, a guy on YouTube will provide you with pre-recorded lessons, where they don't know their audience’s strengths or weaknesses and hence lack, to address your doubts and deliver quality outcomes.

But when you opt for 1×1 sessions, you get connected with a mentor and get a clear understanding of how you both work. They will eventually know your strengths and weakness, which helps them build a strategy that works for you and acquire new skill
