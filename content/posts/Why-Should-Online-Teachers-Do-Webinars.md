Wanna build a successful career as a mentor but are not sure how to achieve it?

Well, this post might be just for you.

Before we get into ‘how’ we need to first focus on ‘why’. Why are you not getting any leads?

There could be a variety of reasons such as, students might be hesitant because they are not sure if you will provide value for their money & time. Second, you have to earn the trust of your audience, and this is exactly where the feedback comes in handy, they not only build your trust but also presents how you are different from others.

But then reading this you might say, I don't have such a big audience from where I could get a chunk of feedback, well here is how you can build trust and get input from your students, start implementing WEBINAR in your mentoring journey.

# Perks of Using Webinars

We can use a webinar in a variety of different ways, these don’t require much significant effort and help you as a mentor build a successful carrier. Let’s get into it!

1. **Using Webinars As a Tool:** If you are just getting into your mentoring journey, you don't have to be fancy and start advertising instead start with a cheap alternative i.e. webinar. Use webinars to get people interested and help them to get a hang of your mentoring style and your course/ session. This will save you from a lot of hassles, time & dimes.
2. **Using Webinars to Earn Trust:** As I said earlier, we also need a create a student-mentor relationship and a webinar is a key to this. A webinar is both budget & time friendly for the students, they get a brief understanding of how you & your courses work. This enables their trust in you and they become more likely to apply for your session/courses.
3. **Using Webinars for leads & conversion:** After you start doing webinars you get valuable data on your audience, this data comes very handy when you want to market your other services as well. Now, next time, when you do a session or are selling a course you can upsell to folks, who were interested in the webinars.

This gives your session/ course an extra boost of engagements you might have been lacking. People can come and book their slots for a session or buy your course just through a simple invitation link.

1. **Using Webinars to get Feedback:** Inputs are something that shows your capabilities and also builds trust with your mentees. You can ask your mentees for feedback and present them as testimonials, this will help you generate student leads for the Webinar/ session/ courses.
2. **Using Webinars as a Testing platform:** Let's say you are passionate about Writing and you wanna build a course where you talk about ‘How to Write a Book’ but then you start to think - Are people even interested in such a topic? Would my hard work be paid off?

Well, certainly you can use webinar for trial and error method, this way you do not have to create 10 hours long courses, where you are not sure if it's a hot take in the market. You create a simple webinar that can be an hour long and see if it works, this will save you a lot of time and research which you might have ended up putting in a course only to see it getting low engagements.
