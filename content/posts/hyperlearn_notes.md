Are you building an audience by sharing knowledge?

Yes, then this is a must-read!

You might be writing newsletters, blogs, or probably sharing an ebook.

But doing these things does not provide you with any insights into how your audience is actually reacting to your content and whether is it even relevant to them.

Now, writing newsletters or blogs is a fun way to share information, but the thing is you just don't grasp what people are connecting to the most or which particular section in your blog is generating more traffic. As for eBooks, they can be easily put into media-sharing platforms and all the values go to waste because the information gets lost.

Here the main hurdle is that you don't get any credit for the work you have done, and someone else shares your content without providing you any credits and reaps all benefits, these are real problems that can happen to anyone whether you are an experienced or a newbie in the industry.

So, what if you have a platform where your audience gets to access your knowledge, again and again, engage with it, and you get to see proper insights into your audience and generate traffic using it?

It's simple to start creating cards using Hyperlearn Notes, where nothing gets copied or claimed by others.

## **What is this ‘Hyperlearn Notes’?**

Hyperlearn Notes is a revision tool that makes memorization easier. It’s like a digital version of the flashcards, where learners try to recall answers from the cue provided. As research shows active recall is a great way to improve memorizing new concepts.

With iteration, the learner is able to fully grasp the new subject. Here users have to remember different cards by testing their recall afterward. By using our algorithmic engines for revision, learners increase their chances of remembering information faster and more effectively than through traditional methods alone.

Wanna know how you can use such cards to your advantage as a mentor?

Well, here you go!

## **Easily Generate Traction**

Once you create your Hyperlearn Notes, you can easily flaunt them on your social media handles like LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. People who find interest in the given topics will come through your social media and can easily get your cards.

We share the anonymous stats for those who subscribe to your notes with you.

This is a win-win situation for both the mentor and mentee. The mentee gets to improve on their skills and the mentor gains traction and information about their audience.

So, what's the use of your audience’s info details?

Well, these details enhance your traction and ensure that you are addressing the right audience.

You can do this primarily by:-

**Leading your audience to the webinar/sessions**

Now, you can host your webinars or sessions on Hyperlearn. 

While webinars are a very effective means when you want to showcase your knowledge in a brief session, a 1x1 session enables you to go deeper into the problem of your mentee and use your expert advice.

So, let's say you made a webinar/ session on a topic but now what? Do you have the right audience or any audience at all, if you are a fledgling mentor?

This is where those details about your audience come in handy!

Start upselling your webinars/ sessions to such an audience, remember, webinars are short and to the point, so if students want to further venture into the subject, they can book up a session with you in [Hyperlearn.in](http://Hyperlearn.in) , this ensures you get traffic & traction while students the skills and new insights.

Ok, now let's address the elephant in the room!!

How can you make these cards?

Well, Let's get into it!

# How To Create Your Notes With Hyperlearn?

After you have successfully created a Hyperlearn account, you can easily make notes from your mentor dashboard.

Just beside the section ‘My Deck’ you can see a ‘Manage Deck’ button, click to go to the deck detail view.

![Deck Main Page](/blog/deck_main_page_(1).png)

If you notice there are 2 kinds of decks available on your screen.

My Deck & Subscribed Deck

In ‘My Deck’ you can easily find all the decks which you have created.

As for ‘Subscribed Decks’ these are the decks, created by other mentors to which you have subscribed.


![Deck Creation](/blog/deck_creation1.png)

Continuing back on creating a deck.

Click on the ‘Create Deck’ button at the top right corner of the page, to create a new deck for your cards.

A modal will pop up here when clicking on ‘Create Deck’. Now, here you have to type the name of your deck and attach a thumbnail picture with it.

Also, don't forget to set your deck as ‘Public’ where the deck will be visible to others, or ‘Private’ where the deck will be only visible to you.

As you can see there is a name and an image, you may change this thumbnail by clicking on ‘Change Thumbnail’ anytime.

Once satisfied with the look of the name and the thumbnail, press the ‘Create’ button.

Now, let's create flashcards, these flashcards will be shown to mentees and help them learn effectively.

After you open the deck, click on the ‘Create Card’ button to add cards to the deck. A modal box will appear where you add your question and answer. 

Let's create your first question card!

![Deck Creation](/blog/deck_creation6.png)

Type your question and change it however you like it. You may also add a hint, which helps your mentees to recall answers if they ever get confused.

Adding an image is beneficial, so that your mentees can relate, the question to the image and can instantly connect the dots.

Here, you also get a preview of the card where your question with an image appears and a hint indicates green.

That's it for the question! But every question has an answer for it, so let's create an answer card by clicking on ‘Write Answer’.

![Deck Creation](/blog/deck_creation7.png)

Again, you have to type your answer and change it however you want, and don't forget to add an image so that the mentees can remember things better.

You can also preview these cards by clicking on the ‘Preview’ button.

Just as in the question card, you get to preview the card, where your answer with an image appears.

Once you click on the ‘Show Question’ button the card will flip and the answer card will appear, similarly.

If something looks out of place you can re-edit it and change them accordingly.

![Deck Creation](/blog/deck_creation8.png)

Now, when you are satisfied with how your card looks, you just have to press the ‘Create’ button.

And Viola! There you have it, your first flash card. Now you can create more flashcards and make a deck.
