Start by filling in your details for your ‘Profile’. Upload your profile picture, then type your name, email address, languages you speak, your experience in years, companies you have previously worked for, skills you possess, a tagline (e.g. - Software Engineer) and, write a decent introduction about yourself in ‘Bio’. Then go ahead and press ‘save and continue.’

Congrats! You have created your profile online.

# Creating a Hyperlearn Session

Now, don't stop after making a profile, let's learn to create your first ‘session’. Start by giving a relevant name to your session. These sessions should be related to what you wanna teach, for e.g. resume writing, intro on GitHub, or maybe graphic designing. Then make sure to choose if you want a 1x1 session or a group session. Here, you can also select the time duration for each session.

 If you like, you can opt to create a free session by simply checking the box ‘Make this session free’ or you can add a price tag for your session (note that, if you want you can even make discounts for your session).

Fill in your session details briefly and then press on ‘save and continue.’

Now, let's set your timings for the session booking.

Let's sync your google calendar with your profile, note that, this step is very crucial and helps us book your session only when you have free time slots available in your calendar. It also ensures that you are not overbooked. At last, don't forget to select your preferred working days and timings.

Finally, you can press submit!

![Profile Submitted Successfully](/blog/awesome_profile_6.jpg)

A dialogue box with ‘ Profile submitted successfully’ will appear. You can add more information to your account to make it easier for your mentees to connect with you. So, now you have your own mentor ‘dashboard’ and a ‘Profile’.

If you want to know more about the dashboard and profile, you may read our blog - [https://www.hyperlearn.in/blog/posts/how-to-supercharge-your-mentoring-with-hyperlearn/](https://www.hyperlearn.in/blog/posts/how-to-supercharge-your-mentoring-with-hyperlearn/)

# Don't Miss the Details!

Now, to enhance your profile to another level, don't forget to link your social media handles such as LinkedIn, Github, Behance, etc. People can now easily connect with you and understand you a bit better.

Adding featured works passively illustrates your experience in the field. So, post your credentials and achievements in ‘Featured work’ and showcase your expertise. 

Lastly, anyone can introduce themselves with those boring Bio sections, right? 

Then why not try introducing yourself through a video, it totally sets you apart from other mentors and mentees get to know more about you a lot through a video than by reading your bio.

Once you are satisfied with the look of your profile, you can request for your profile to be approved and then start accepting session bookings and help your mentees to clear their doubts.

# Your Mentoring Journey

At the end of the day, no journey is easy, whether you are an aspiring mentor or a curious individual, who gets frightened by the process of mentoring. This might not come as new to you, but the first step, you take is the difficult one, after which your ride may not always be smooth but it keeps on going.
