Managing mentorship with a full-time job, is a very tedious task. You cannot just go with a ‘spray and pray’ approach, every time. Occasionally it needs a personal touch.

Not to mention, helping people to become their best selves is already a complicated thing. And, adding to it, are the following problems, which mentors face:-

- How to show and present your services to your prospective customers
- Scheduling calls with your mentees and striking a healthy work-life balance
- Seamlessly getting paid
- Collecting leads of prospective students

And, this is where we come and save a mentor’s day. We have built hyperlearn, to make it easy for a mentor to showcase their skill, connect with students and manage their payments
