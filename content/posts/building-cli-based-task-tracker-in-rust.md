Let's build a Task Board in Rust

Our Goals
- - It should have 3 lists pending, In progress, done
- You should be able to add new tasks, which should get added in pending list
- You should be able to move items from pending to in Progress or in progress to Done....move from In Progress to pending or done to pending
- you should be able to list all the tasks
